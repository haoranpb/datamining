# Product-Catalog-Size-Recommendation-Framework
This framework is based on the algorithm proposed in the paper **Decomposing Fit Semantics for Product Size Recommendation in Metric Spaces** published at **RecSys 2018**. 

It consists of collaborative filtering and metric learning components for predicting the fit of different catalog sizes of clothing products so as to recommend appropriately sized products to customers.

We also contributed two clothing fit datasets from [Modcloth](https://www.modcloth.com/) and [Renttherunway](https://www.renttherunway.com/) retail websites. Details of the datasets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation).

## Prerequisites
* Install PyLMNN library from [here](https://pypi.org/project/PyLMNN/).
* Download the datasets from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation).
